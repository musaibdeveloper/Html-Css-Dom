<!-- 
 HTML pages are text documents.
X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
X Tags are often referred to as elements.
X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
X Attributes require a name and a value. -->
